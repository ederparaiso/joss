# Jira on Spreadsheets (joss)
## (Work in progress)
Not Joss Stone or Joss Whedon neither, just a simple scripts to manage your jira issues on google spreadsheets!

Create and update Jira issues is an awful work as the number of issues grows.

Inspired by visual studio tfs plugin where users could manage tfs tasks in a simple excel spreadsheet, I built this [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) project extending google sheets capabilities using [Jira rest api](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3) to manage some issues operations.

For a while, project creating still manual. Create an google spreadsheet an go to `Tools > Script editor`. Then create and copy & paste script files in this project.

Future versions intent to use [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) to deploy project files to google apps script.
